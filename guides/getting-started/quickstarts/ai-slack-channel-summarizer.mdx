## Features

* Gather data from websites
* Send processed data to Slack

### Step 1: Fork the template

Login to Replit and then fork the [AI Slack summary template](https://replit.com/@replit-matt/Slack-Channel-Summary-Bot#summary%5Fbot/app.py), select the **\+ Use Template** button at the top right of the page. Follow the onscreen instructions to complete the fork and create a Repl.

### Step 2: Create the app in the Slack developer portal

Follow the instructions below to create and install a Slack app into your Slack workspace:

1. Navigate to [**Your Apps**](https://api.slack.com/apps) page and select **Create an App**.
2. Choose **From an app manifest** from the options.
3. Select a Workspace from the dropdown menu and then select **Next**.
4. Replace the JSON content with the content of the [manifest.json](https://replit.com/@replit-matt/Slack-Channel-Summary-Bot#assets/manifest.json) file, then select **Next**.
5. Review and configure your **OAuth** permissions, **Features**, and **Settings**, then select **Create**.
6. Select **Install the App**.

Note: You might need admin approval to install the App based on your organization's policies.

### Step 3: Get tokens from Slack developer portal

Follow these instructions to obtain the necessary tokens:

1. **SLACK\_BOT\_TOKEN:** Navigate to your [Slack App page](https://api.slack.com/apps), then to Settings -> Install App. Under OAuth Tokens for your Workspace, copy the **Bot User OAuth Token** and use it to update the `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` Secret key in your Repl.
2. **SLACK\_SIGNING\_SECRET:** On your Slack App page, go to Settings -> Basic Information. In the **App Credentials** section, locate the **Signing Secret** and use it to update the `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` Secret key in your Repl.
3. **SLACK\_APP\_TOKEN:** On your Slack App page, go to Settings -> Basic Information. In the _App-Level Tokens_ section, select **Generate Token and Scopes**. Add a **Token Name**, choose your desired permissions, and select **Generate**. Copy the generated token and use it to update the `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` Secret key in your Repl.
4. **OPENAI\_API\_KEY:** The API key is generated by registering your application on the open API provider's platform and creating a new application within their developer portal. The key is then generated and provided for authentication purposes.

Save all of these secrets to Replit by opening the **Secrets** tab in the Replit Workspace and pasting the values in.

### Step 4: Deploy your Slack bot on Replit

In the Workspace header, select the **Deploy** button located on the top right of your Repl, and from the available types of Deployments, choose **Reserved VM Deployments**. Select the **Set up your deployment** button, followed by the **Deploy** button to deploy your application.

### Step 5: Testing your bot

To summarize a channel, add your App to the channel and send it a direct message. Then, use the command `summarize-channel #my-channel 24` to summarize the activity in `#my-channel` from the past 24 hours.

**Example:**

```
/summarize-channel #my-channel 24

```

This command summarizes the `#my-channel` channel from the previous 24 hours. Adjust the channel name and duration according to your preferences.

## **Further customization**

* **Customizable summarization criteria:** Customize summaries to focus on specific keywords or topics.
* **Integration with additional platforms:** Extend functionality by integrating with other platforms.
* **Personalized alert messages:** Customize message content and formatting for Slack alerts.
* **Dynamic summarization frequency:** Set different summarization intervals for channels or topics.
