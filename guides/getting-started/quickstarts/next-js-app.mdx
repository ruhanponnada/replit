Follow the steps below to get your `Next.js` app up and running on Replit:

### Step 1: Fork the template

Login to Replit and fork the [Next.js template](https://replit.com/@replit/Nextjs?v=1#README.md) by selecting the **\+ Use Template** button located at the top right of the page. Follow the onscreen instructions to complete the fork and create a Repl.

### Step 2: Deploy the application

In the Workspace header, select the **Deploy** button and choose **Autoscale** from the types of Deployments. Then, select the **Set up your deployment** button and use the following configuration:

* **Machine configuration:** You can keep the default values. The default machine configuration is a 1vCPU and 2 GiB RAM.
* **Max number of machines:** Keep the default value of 3.
* **Primary domains:** Choose a domain name for your app.
* **Build command:** Enter the command `npm run build` into the **Build command** field.
* **Run command:** Enter the command `npm run start` into the **Run command** field.

Select the **Deploy** button to deploy your application.

After a few minutes, your app will be live!

In the future, if you want to update your deployment, open the Deployments pane and either **Redeploy** or update the config in the settings.
