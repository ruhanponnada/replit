  If your Repl is failing to load, try these debugging steps:

  1. Test your [internet connection](https://www.speedtest.net/).
  2. Try a different browser.
  3. Check if your browser has enabled JavaScript.
  4. Use the command `kill 1` in the shell to kill and restart the virtual Linux machine backing your Repl.

  If none of the above steps helped, check Replit's [Service Status](https://status.replit.com). If you see the status as **All systems are go!** and you still have issues loading your Repl, please get in touch with [Replit Support](https://replit.com/support).

To copy files from your local machine to the remote machine, use this syntax:`scp filename username@ip_address:/home/username`

    You can also copy entire directories using scp.
