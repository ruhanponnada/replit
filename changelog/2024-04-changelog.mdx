## Workspace

### Scheduled Deployments

Scheduled Deployments are now available in the **Deployments Pane**.

We’ve made it easier to schedule tasks without deep technical setup. Simply tell Replit when to run your application using natural language, such as "Run this script every Tuesday and Thursday at 3:00 PM." We’ll handle the conversion into the necessary cron expressions. You can use Scheduled Deployments to automate Slack analytics reports, periodic data cleanups, routine system health checks, and more. Currently, Scheduled Deployments support a configuration of 1vCPU and 2 GiB RAM and allow up to 11 hours for the longest job, with no concurrency limits on the jobs scheduled.

With Scheduled Deployments, you can more efficiently automate and manage applications that need to be redeployed at specific, granular intervals. To read more and learn about pricing, check out the full [blog post](https://blog.replit.com/scheduled-deployments).

### Replit Teams early access

* **Replit-native collaboration**: Speed up code reviews and merges with tools designed for efficient teamwork.
* **Role-based access control (RBAC)**: Keep your projects secure with access controls that allow you to easily manage team roles and permissions.

### Advanced port configuration
New port configuration features make it easier to work on complex or multiple services within a single project:

* **Explicit port mappings**: Ports consistently retain their mapping once they are opened. This change is reflected in the `.replit` configuration file, which also stores other project settings. This simplifies the setup for projects that involve running multiple services.
* **Improved port visibility and management**: You’ll get a notification in the Shell or Console whenever a port is opened. There are options to view, configure, or stop exposing the port, which improves control over which ports are accessible.

* **Localhost port handling**: To support developers who utilize localhost, there is now a popup notification that allows you to expose localhost ports if you choose.
* **Webview port switching**: The Webview now allows you to switch between active ports easily, facilitating the testing and use of applications that listen on multiple ports simultaneously.

## Developer experience

### Nix packages saved[​](/updates#nix-packages-saved "Direct link to Nix packages saved")

You can now build your Nix environment once and enjoy it always (even across forks). If you ever added a package to `replit.nix` and noticed that your Repl spent a long time Building Nix Environment on startup, this will now start instantly (after one last build).

Whatever you build with Nix counts against your storage quota. Check how much disk space Nix packages are using in the **Storage** details of the **Resources** menu. If you select the trash can, you can clear all storage used by Nix packages. We still maintain a very large cache of Nix packages, and using any of these prebuilt packages does not count against your storage quota.
