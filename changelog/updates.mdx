* **Replit Mobile App updates** \- New Recent Deployments section and tablet improvements.

**Explorers**: If you want to try new features as soon as they are available, turn on the Explorer role in your [Account Settings](https://replit.com/account#roles).

## Workspace

### Object Storage

Replit Object Storage allows you to store and manage unstructured data like media files, documents, and other content types efficiently. It's built to be resilient, handling simultaneous reads and writes, and scales seamlessly to accommodate growing application demands.
<Frame>

</Frame>

Here’s what you need to know:

* **Minimal configuration**: It works right out of the box in the Replit Workspace and deployment environments.
* **Versatile options**: Ideal for storing large volumes of unstructured data such as images, user-generated content like PDFs, and data files including CSV and JSON.
* **Integration with existing tools**: We provide libraries in Python and TypeScript to interact with Object Storage, making it accessible with minimal code.

Additionally, Object Storage is powered by Google Cloud Storage, ensuring high durability and performance. This means you’ll have automated scaling and a reduction in latency.

To integrate Object Storage into your project, navigate to the **Tools** menu, select **Object Storage** to open a new pane, and create a new bucket.
<Frame>

</Frame>
Write, read, and upload to GCP-backed Object Storage in only a few lines of code. For more details on how to use this feature, check out the [full blog post](https://blog.replit.com/object-storage) or the [documentation](https://docs.replit.com/category/object-storage).

### Improved Deployment logs

We’re launching an improved logs experience for Deployments. Logs now include:

* Built-in search
* Log & error highlighting
* 30-day persistence
* More filters like date and log type
* General performance enhancements (faster loads!)
<Frame>

</Frame>

### CPU & RAM monitoring for Deployments

We added CPU and RAM monitoring to Deployments. Now, you can easily get basic system information about your Deployment machine directly from your Replit Workspace.

### Merge conflict markers

Merge conflicts are now highlighted during merging and rebasing, so you can resolve them quickly, without leaving the editor.
<Frame>
  <img src="https://docimg.replit.com/images/changelog/2024-05-16/merge-conflicts.png"/>
</Frame>

## Mobile
### Recent Deployments section

The Replit Mobile App now has a **Recent Deployments** section at the top of the My Repls screen, which makes it easier to access and monitor your recent projects.

### Tablet improvements

We’ve upgraded the Replit Mobile App experience for tablet users. When you connect a keyboard, you can now access the full Replit Workspace as you would in a browser on your computer, as compared to the mobile version.

Download the latest version of the Replit Mobile App in the [App Store or Google Play Store](https://replit.com/mobile).

## Developer experience

### `code path/to/file`

You can now use `code path/to/file` to create and open new files. Opening files with `code` or `xdg-open` no longer creates a new Pane group every time. This change also applies to git commit message editing.

### Programmatic access to dev URLs

Now, you can get the dev URL for your Repl programmatically using the environment variable `REPLIT_DEV_DOMAIN`.

## Documentation

The following docs have been updated for clarity and to accompany new features:

* [Object Storage](https://docs.replit.com/category/object-storage)
* [Configure a Repl](https://docs.replit.com/replit-workspace/configuring-repl)
* [Account inactivity](https://docs.replit.com/legal-and-security-info/account-inactivity)

**Welcome to the Replit Changelog.**

Last month, we released many new features and improvements designed to boost your productivity, collaboration, and coding experience on Replit. Some of the key highlights include:

* **Replit Teams early access** \- [Sign up for the waitlist today](https://replit.com/teams) to join the beta of Replit Teams.
* **[Scheduled Deployments](https://docs.replit.com/cloud-services/deployments/scheduled-deployments)** \- Schedule tasks without deep technical setup.
* **[Advanced port configuration](https://docs.replit.com/replit-workspace/ports)** \- Explicit port mappings, improved port management, and more.

**Explorers**: If you want to try new features as soon as they are available, turn on the Explorer role in your [Account Settings](https://replit.com/account#roles).

## Workspace

### Scheduled Deployments

Scheduled Deployments are now available in the **Deployments Pane**.

We’ve made it easier to schedule tasks without deep technical setup. Simply tell Replit when to run your application using natural language, such as "Run this script every Tuesday and Thursday at 3:00 PM." We’ll handle the conversion into the necessary cron expressions. You can use Scheduled Deployments to automate Slack analytics reports, periodic data cleanups, routine system health checks, and more. Currently, Scheduled Deployments support a configuration of 1vCPU and 2 GiB RAM and allow up to 11 hours for the longest job, with no concurrency limits on the jobs scheduled.

With Scheduled Deployments, you can more efficiently automate and manage applications that need to be redeployed at specific, granular intervals. To read more and learn about pricing, check out the full [blog post](https://blog.replit.com/scheduled-deployments).

### Replit Teams early access

We’re reinventing how software is developed collaboratively and with AI, so that every part of your team can have the tools to build and ship something great.
<Frame>

</Frame>
The [waitlist](https://replit.com/teams) is now open for early access to the Replit Teams beta. Here’s what you can expect from Replit Teams:

* **Organizational intelligence**: Unleash AI-powered code completion, chat, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) across your team.
* **Ultra-fast workspaces**: Access 8vCPUs and 16GB RAM machines, ensuring a smooth workspace experience for your whole team.
* **Shared deployments**: Deployments that can be managed and redeployed by anyone on the team, streamlining your workflow.
* **Living repos**: With a dynamic, collaborative dashboard, you can see who’s coding, get a top-level view of in-progress work, and effortlessly dive back into tasks.
* **Replit-native collaboration**: Speed up code reviews and merges with tools designed for efficient teamwork.
* **Role-based access control (RBAC)**: Keep your projects secure with access controls that allow you to easily manage team roles and permissions.
* **Centralized billing**: Simplify your team’s operations with a straightforward billing system for deployments, compute resources, and more, all in one place.

### Advanced port configuration
New port configuration features make it easier to work on complex or multiple services within a single project:

* **Explicit port mappings**: Ports consistently retain their mapping once they are opened. This change is reflected in the `.replit` configuration file, which also stores other project settings. This simplifies the setup for projects that involve running multiple services.
* **Improved port visibility and management**: You’ll get a notification in the Shell or Console whenever a port is opened. There are options to view, configure, or stop exposing the port, which improves control over which ports are accessible.
<Frame>
  <img src="https://docimg.replit.com/images/changelog/2024-03-14/ports-networking.png"/>
</Frame>
* **Localhost port handling**: To support developers who utilize localhost, there is now a popup notification that allows you to expose localhost ports if you choose.
* **Webview port switching**: The Webview now allows you to switch between active ports easily, facilitating the testing and use of applications that listen on multiple ports simultaneously.
<Frame>

## Developer experience

### Nix packages saved[​](/updates#nix-packages-saved "Direct link to Nix packages saved")

You can now build your Nix environment once and enjoy it always (even across forks). If you ever added a package to `replit.nix` and noticed that your Repl spent a long time Building Nix Environment on startup, this will now start instantly (after one last build).

Whatever you build with Nix counts against your storage quota. Check how much disk space Nix packages are using in the **Storage** details of the **Resources** menu. If you select the trash can, you can clear all storage used by Nix packages. We still maintain a very large cache of Nix packages, and using any of these prebuilt packages does not count against your storage quota.
